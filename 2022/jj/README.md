Solutions will be organized by day.

Separate inputs, and respective solutions, for Part1 and Part2 will be included in separate text files.

Decided to try Haskell over Rust, first time using it.

Some notes:
- with cabal, need to use license or some stuff doesn't work.
  - `cabal init -s "Advent of Code 2022, Day <n>" -l BSD3`

~~This is my firat attempt at learning the Rust programming language.~~
