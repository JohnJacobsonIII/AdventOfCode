# 2023 Advent of Code attempts

Hope everyone is ready for some winter code challenges!

We'll try to maintain some group metadata here on the front page on how everyone is doing.

It's suggested that all participants attempt to solve the challenges in an unfamiliar programming language. Some good choices might be:
- Elixir
- Haskell
- Ocaml
- Go
- C/C++
- C#
- Racket
- Java
- Rust
- Mojo
